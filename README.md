# PartFactoryModelSimulation
This is a simulation of the producer-consumer model based on a multi-threaded environment in C++. It utilizes various locking mechanisms, thread synchronization mechanisms such as condition variables for communication, a distributed buffer, and the transformation of data into atomic types to enhance the efficiency of concurrent processing in the system. This model can be further used for performance optimization in industrial production simulations.
